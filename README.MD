# Data ellipse

The concept of the data ellipse was introduced in the very first studies of linear regression in the 19th century. The data ellipse can provide a visual (and quantitative) insight into linear models, as it represents a specific relationship with the underlying data. In particular, a data ellipse can be calculated to enclose approximately 100(1-Î±)% of all data points in a scatterplot. 

This repository contains a Matlab software to calculate and plot data ellipses, as well as an excel file where data can be simply pasted to obtain the data ellipse.


## In Matlab

Download the Matlab file "data_ellipse.m", add the path to your Matlab's path and run :

```matlab
data_ellipse.demo()
```
